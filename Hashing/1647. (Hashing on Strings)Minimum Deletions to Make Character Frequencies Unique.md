### 1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique

Problem Statement
```md

A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string. For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aab"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already good.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
Example 3:

Input: s = "ceabaacb"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s contains only lowercase English letters.

class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletions(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> umap;
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        int ans = 0;

        // Count the frequency of each character
        for (char c : s) {
            umap[c]++;
        }

        for (auto &it : umap) {
            int val = it.second;
            while (seen.find(val) != seen.end()) {
                // If the frequency is already seen, decrement it
                val--;
                ans++;
            }
            if (val > 0) {
                seen.insert(val);
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};

         //S-O(26)
        vector<int> farr(26, 0);
        
        // Count the frequency of each character in the input string and update farr
        //T-O(N)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            if (farr[i] == 0) {
                break;  // If the frequency is 0, exit the loop
            }
            
            if (farr[i] < farr[i + 1]) {
                // No problem, frequencies are already sorted
            } else {
                // We have to delete a character to make frequencies unique
                int cur = farr[i];
                farr[i] = farr[i] - 1;  // Decrement the frequency
                ans += 1;  // Increment the deletion count
            }
        }
        
        return ans;  // Return the minimum deletions required
    }
