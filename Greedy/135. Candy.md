### 135. Candy

```md

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 

Example 1:

Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
 

Constraints:

n == ratings.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

```


#### Logic

```md

1- Each child must have at least one candy.
2- Children with a higher rating should receive more candies than their neighbors.

Here's the intuition behind the program:

1- Initialization: Two arrays, fromleft and fromright, are created to store the number of candies each child will receive from their left and right neighbors, respectively. Both arrays are initialized with 1, as each child must have at least one candy initially.

2- Traverse from Left to Right: The program first traverses the ratings array from left to right. If the current child's rating is higher than the previous one, they should receive more candies than the previous child. Therefore, it updates the fromleft array accordingly. The number of candies for the current child is incremented by the number of candies the previous child received from their left.

3 - Traverse from Right to Left: Next, the program traverses the ratings array from right to left. If the current child's rating is higher than the next one (i.e., their right neighbor), they should receive more candies than their right neighbor. It updates the fromright array similarly, incrementing the number of candies for the current child by the number of candies the next child received from their right.

4 - Calculate the Total Number of Candies: After updating both fromleft and fromright arrays, the program calculates the total number of candies needed. It does this by iterating through the ratings array again and, for each child, taking the maximum of the number of candies from their left (fromleft[i]) and the number of candies from their right (fromright[i]). This ensures that both conditions are satisfied.

#### code
```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = ratings.size();
        
        // Create two arrays to store the number of candies from the left and right for each child.
        vector<int> fromleft(n, 1);   // Initialize all children with at least 1 candy.
        vector<int> fromright(n, 1);  // Initialize all children with at least 1 candy.

        // Traverse the ratings from left to right, updating the 'fromleft' array.
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                // If the current child has a higher rating than the previous one, give them more candies.
                fromleft[i] = fromleft[i] + fromleft[i - 1];
            }
        }

        // Traverse the ratings from right to left, updating the 'fromright' array.
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                // If the current child has a higher rating than the next one, give them more candies.
                fromright[i] = fromright[i] + fromright[i + 1];
            }
        }

        int ans = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total number of candies needed by taking the maximum of 'fromleft' and 'fromright' for each child.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans += max(fromleft[i], fromright[i]);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
