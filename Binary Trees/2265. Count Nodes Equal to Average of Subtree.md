### 2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree


```md

Given the root of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the average of the values in its subtree.

Note:

The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.
A subtree of root is a tree consisting of root and all of its descendants.
 
```

```md
Example 1:


Input: root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
For the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 6) / 6 = 24 / 6 = 4.
For the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is (5 + 6) / 2 = 11 / 2 = 5.
For the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.
For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
For the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.

###### code


```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int matchingSubtreeCount = 0; // Initialize the count of subtrees with matching averages.

    // A Depth-First Search (DFS) function and returns a pair of values:
    // - The sum of values within the current subtree.
    // - The number of nodes within the current subtree.
    pair<int, int> calculateSubtreeValues(TreeNode* currentNode) {
        if (currentNode == nullptr)
            return {0, 0}; // Base case: Return 0 for both sum and number of nodes if the node is null.

        // Recursively calculate values for the left and right subtrees.
        auto leftSubtree = calculateSubtreeValues(currentNode->left);
        auto rightSubtree = calculateSubtreeValues(currentNode->right);

        // Calculate the sum of values and the number of nodes in the current subtree.
        int sumOfValues = leftSubtree.first + rightSubtree.first + currentNode->val;
        int numberOfNodes = leftSubtree.second + rightSubtree.second + 1;

        // Check if the current node's value matches the average of its subtree.
        if (sumOfValues / numberOfNodes == currentNode->val)
            matchingSubtreeCount++; 

        return {sumOfValues, numberOfNodes}; // Return the calculated values for the current subtree.
    }

    int averageOfSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
        calculateSubtreeValues(root); // Start the DFS from the root node.
        return matchingSubtreeCount; 
    }
};
