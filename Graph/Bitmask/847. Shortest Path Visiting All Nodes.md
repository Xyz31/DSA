### 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes

```md

You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.

 

Example 1:

```

![shortest1-graph](https://github.com/Xyz31/DSA/assets/95264887/b1f004c2-4e80-4d99-b4d0-fba6c8fe51f1)
```md
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]

Example 2:
```
![shortest2-graph](https://github.com/Xyz31/DSA/assets/95264887/50c255ce-4ef0-408b-93d4-feb81787fdf0)

```md

Input: graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
 

Constraints:

n == graph.length
1 <= n <= 12
0 <= graph[i].length < n
graph[i] does not contain i.
If graph[a] contains b, then graph[b] contains a.
The input graph is always connected.

#### code BFS+Bitmask
```cpp

class Solution {
private:
    int Bfs(vector<vector<int>> &graph) {
        int n = graph.size(); // Number of nodes in the graph
        int allnodes = (1 << n) - 1; // A bitmask representing all nodes as '1's
        set<pair<int, int>> vis; // Set to keep track of visited nodes with their bitmask
        queue<tuple<int, int, int>> q; // Queue for BFS traversal
        
        // Initialize the BFS queue with all nodes
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int initialMask = (1 << i); // Create a bitmask with a single '1' for the current node
            q.push({i, 0, initialMask}); // Push the current node, its distance, and the bitmask into the queue
            vis.insert({i, initialMask}); // Mark the current node as visited with its bitmask
        }

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [node, dist, mask] = q.front(); // Dequeue the current node, its distance, and its bitmask
            q.pop();
            
            // Explore adjacent nodes in the graph
            for (auto adjacent : graph[node]) {
                int newMask = (mask | (1 << adjacent)); // Create a new bitmask by adding the adjacent node

                // If the new bitmask represents all nodes, we have visited all nodes
                if (newMask == allnodes) {
                    return dist + 1; // Return the total distance (distance to this node + 1)
                }
                
                // Check if we have already visited the adjacent node with the same bitmask
                if (vis.count({adjacent, newMask})) {
                    continue; // Skip this iteration if we have visited it
                } else {
                    // Push the adjacent node, its updated distance, and the new bitmask into the queue
                    q.push({adjacent, dist + 1, newMask});
                    vis.insert({adjacent, newMask}); // Mark the adjacent node as visited with its new bitmask
                }
            }
        }
        return 0; // Return 0 if no shortest path is found
    }

public:
    int shortestPathLength(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        if (graph.size() <= 1) return 0; // If there are 0 or 1 nodes, the shortest path length is 0

        return Bfs(graph); // Call the BFS function to find the shortest path length
    }
};
