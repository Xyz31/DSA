## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental to computer science and are essential skills for software development. This project aims to help you explore, learn, and practice DSA concepts using C++ as the primary programming language. While this repository is private, you can still use it as a reference, study resource, or as a starting point for your own DSA projects.

## Topics Covered

Here's a brief overview of the topics covered in this repository:

1. **Prefix Techniques**: Learn how to efficiently process prefixes in sequences.

2. **Sliding Window**: Explore algorithms that use sliding windows to solve subarray or substring problems.

3. **Two Pointers**: Understand the two-pointer technique for optimizing array and list traversals.

4. **Bit Manipulation**: Dive into bitwise operations and their applications.

5. **Linked List**: Implement and manipulate linked lists in C++.

6. **Greedy Techniques**: Study greedy algorithms for solving optimization problems.

7. **Recursion and Backtracking**: Master recursive algorithms and backtracking strategies.

8. **Binary Search**: Implement binary search algorithms for efficient searching.

9. **Heaps (Heap Data Structure)**: Learn about the heap data structure and its applications.

10. **Stack and Queue**: Explore stack and queue implementations and their uses.

11. **Strings**: Handle strings effectively, including string manipulation and pattern matching.

12. **Binary Tree**: Implement binary tree data structures and related algorithms.

13. **Graph Algorithms**: Study graph algorithms for traversals, shortest paths, and more.

14. **Dynamic Programming**: Solve complex problems using dynamic programming techniques.

15. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Implement a trie data structure for efficient string-related operations.

These topics cover a wide range of DSA concepts and will help you build a strong foundation in algorithmic problem-solving with C++.
