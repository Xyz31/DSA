### 880. Decoded String at Index

```md

You are given an encoded string s. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:

If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
If the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more times in total.
Given an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leet2code3", k = 10
Output: "o"
Explanation: The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
The 10th letter in the string is "o".
Example 2:

Input: s = "ha22", k = 5
Output: "h"
Explanation: The decoded string is "hahahaha".
The 5th letter is "h".
Example 3:

Input: s = "a2345678999999999999999", k = 1
Output: "a"
Explanation: The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times.
The 1st letter is "a".
 

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of lowercase English letters and digits 2 through 9.
s starts with a letter.
1 <= k <= 109
It is guaranteed that k is less than or equal to the length of the decoded string.
The decoded string is guaranteed to have less than 263 letters.

char c = s[i];
To check c is character use : isalpha(c);
To check c is digit use : isdigit(c);

```cpp

class Solution {
public:

        int n = s.length();
        long long size = 0; // Initialize size to keep track of the total size of decoded string.

        // Calculate the size of the decoded string.
        for (char c : s) {
            if (isalpha(c)) {
                size++; // Alphabetic characters contribute 1 to the size.
            } else {
                size = size * (c - '0'); // Digits represent repetition, so multiply size accordingly.
            }
        }

        // Iterate through the string in reverse order.
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            k = k % size; // Update k to be the remainder when divided by size.

            if (k == 0 && isalpha(s[i])) {
                // If k becomes 0 and the current character is alphabetic,
                // it means we've found the k-th character, so return it.
                return string(1, s[i]);
            }

            if (isdigit(s[i])) {
                // If the current character is a digit, adjust the size by dividing it.
                size = size / (s[i] - '0');
            } else {
                // If the current character is alphabetic, decrement the size by 1.
                size--;
            }
        }

        return ""; // Return an empty string if k-th character is not found.
    }
